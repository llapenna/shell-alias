# Shell alias

A list of helpful (and funny too) aliases for UNIX systems.

It compiles a list of aliases that I use in my daily work. I hope you find them
useful. If you have any suggestions, please let me know or open a pull request!

## Usage

Just copy the content of the file `shell_aliases` to your shell's config file.
Depending on your shell, the file is located at:

- bash: `~/.bash_aliases`. If it doesn't exist, you are free to create it. It
should be loaded by `~/.bashrc` automatically.
- zsh: `~/.zshrc`.

After that, you can either restart your shell or run the following command
to apply the changes.

```shell
source [shell's config file]
```
